# Kinect sketches

Some Processing sketches that make use of the Kinect v1 sensor (unfortunately, they will not work with the newer Kinect v2 model).

The sketches in the `src/sketches` directory can be run with [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/). You only need to update the class paths to the libs paths in your system.

Alternatively, you can use the Processing IDE with the sketches located in the `pde` directory.


# Requirements

In order to run these sketches you need to install the following libraries:

  * [Processing 3.0](http://processing.org/)
  * [SimpleOpenNI](https://code.google.com/archive/p/simple-openni/): you will need the Processing 3.0 compatible version by [jaegonlee](https://github.com/jaegonlee/SimpleOpenNI)
  * [ControlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)
  * [OpenCV for Processing](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing)
  * [toxiclibs](http://toxiclibs.org/): get the latest version [here](https://bitbucket.org/postspectacular/toxiclibs/downloads/)

You also need to install the [libfreenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) library to be able to communicate with the Kinect v1 sensor. If you are a Linux user, this [short note](https://github.com/jagracar/software-notes/blob/master/installing_simpleOpenNI) explains you how to install it.

# Kinect 3D scanner demo

Some time ago I made a video showing how to use the Kinect Scanner. It's based on an older version of the sketch, but it is probably still useful to get an idea. Click on the image to be redirected to the vimeo video.
