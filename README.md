# kinectSketches

Some Processing 3.0 sketches that make use of the Kinect v1 sensor (unfortunately, these sketches will not work with the Kinect v2).

The sketches in the /src directory can be run with [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/). You will have to update the class paths to the libs location in your system.

Alternatively, you can use the Processing IDE and the sketches in the /pde directory.


# Requirements

In order to run these sketches you need to install the following libraries:

  * [Processing 3.0](http://processing.org/)
  * [SimpleOpenNI](https://code.google.com/archive/p/simple-openni/): you will need the Processing 3.0 compatible version by [jaegonlee](https://github.com/jaegonlee/SimpleOpenNI)
  * [ControlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)
  * [OpenCV for Processing](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing)
  * [toxiclibs](http://toxiclibs.org/): get the latest version [here](https://bitbucket.org/postspectacular/toxiclibs/downloads/)

You will also need to install the [libfreenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) library to be able to communicate with the Kinect v1 sensor. If you are a Linux user, this [short note](https://github.com/jagracar/software-notes/blob/master/installing_simpleOpenNI) will explain you how to install it.

Have fun!
